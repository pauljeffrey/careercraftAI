I recently completed a professional certification in Healthcare Analytics on Coursera and did a capstone project analyzing diabetes progression using EHR data and logistic regression models.

I also want the resume to highlight that I’ve volunteered remotely for a US-based non-profit for 3 months where I worked with a healthcare data team to clean and visualize hospital patient admission data using Python and Tableau.

My goal is to shift from general business analytics into healthcare-focused data science roles. Please emphasize healthcare-relevant experience, even if it's new. Also include that I’m open to remote roles globally.
